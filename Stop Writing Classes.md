Stop Writing Classes

we ship features, not code! put as little code as possible in our product.
that's funny. I like it.

don't feel like you have to make a stub if you want to implement something later. just do it when you do it!

namespaces are for preventing name collisions, not creating taxonomies.

you probably don't actually need to define a new exception.

a class with two methods including an init is not a class :)
don't make new exceptions when you don't need to.
refactor and rely on state.

reflection:
don't make things abstract and custom when you don't need to.
